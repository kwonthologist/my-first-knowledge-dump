**Author:** [Your Name]  
**Project:** [Your Project Name]  
**Architecture:** Monolithic  
**Experience Level:** 6 years (Full-Stack Software Development)  
**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD

## 1. Mission & Vision
We aim to design, develop, and maintain a high-quality, secure, and scalable monolithic web application leveraging a **Java Spring Boot backend** and **Angular frontend**. The project will emphasize:

- Fast, predictable deployments  
- A strong foundation for security and maintainability  
- Performance monitoring from the earliest stages  
- A solo-agile workflow optimized for rapid delivery without sacrificing quality

## 2. Technology Stack

| Layer        | Technology                          |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| Frontend     | Angular + TypeScript                |
| Backend      | Java Spring Boot (Monolith)         |
| Database     | MySQL + Flyway                      |
| Authentication | Spring Security + JWT            |
| Testing (FE) | Jasmine, Cypress                    |
| Testing (BE) | JUnit, Mockito                      |
| CI/CD        | GitHub Actions, Jenkins             |
| Hosting/Infra| OpenShift / Azure                   |
| Monitoring   | Datadog, Elasticsearch              |
| Security Tools | SonarQube, Fortify, JFrog Xray    |

## 3. Development Guidelines

### 3.1 Frontend Practices
- Angular CLI for scaffolding  
- Modular architecture with shared UI and services  
- SCSS for styles; strict TypeScript typing  
- Angular Reactive Forms for complex form handling  

### 3.2 Backend Practices
- REST controllers in Spring Boot  
- Layered architecture: Controller â†’ Service â†’ Repository  
- Profile-specific configuration via `application.yml`  
- DTO usage for clear API contracts  

### 3.3 Code Quality
- ESLint + Prettier for Angular  
- Checkstyle / SpotBugs for Java  
- SonarQube scan before merging  

---

## 4. Git & Branching Strategy
- **main** â†’ Production-ready  
- **dev** â†’ Staging branch for integration  
- **feature/** â†’ Individual feature branches  

Pull Requests (even solo) must:  
- Pass formatting checks  
- Include self-review  
- Run and pass all automated tests  

---

## 5. CI/CD Workflow

### GitHub Actions (Validation Stage):
1. Lint  
2. Build  
3. Unit Tests  
4. Package  

### Jenkins (Deployment Stage):
1. Build Docker image  
2. Push to container registry  
3. Deploy to OpenShift / Azure  
4. Apply Flyway migrations automatically  

---

## 6. Deployment Standards
- Entire stack dockerized  
- Helm (optional) for deployment manifests  
- Secrets stored securely (Azure Key Vault / OpenShift Secrets)  
- Angular build served through Spring Boot or NGINX  

---

## 7. Testing & QA
- **Frontend:** Jasmine (unit), Cypress (E2E), 80%+ coverage  
- **Backend:** JUnit + Mockito, optional Testcontainers for DB integration  
- **Pipeline:** Tests must pass before merge  

---

## 8. Monitoring & Security

### Monitoring:
- Datadog agent in container  
- Centralized logging with Elasticsearch  
- Error and performance dashboards  

### Security:
- JWT or OAuth2 authentication  
- Dependency scanning (JFrog Xray)  
- OWASP Top 10 compliance checks  
- SonarQube and Fortify scans on schedule  

---

## 9. Solo Agile Workflow
- Kanban board (Notion/Trello) for backlog & progress  
- Weekly sprint rhythm with self-review & retro  
- Monthly architecture review  

---

## 10. Definition of Done
A feature is done when:  
- Code is implemented and merged into `main`  
- Unit & integration tests pass  
- Code is reviewed  
- Deployed to the environment  
- Docs updated  
- Monitoring and alerts are configured (if needed)
