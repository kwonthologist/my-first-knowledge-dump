# 🏗 Portable Monolithic Architecture Blueprint

## 1. Purpose
This blueprint serves as a **reusable architectural template** for building monolithic applications that combine frontend, backend, and database layers into a **single deployable unit**.

It can be adapted for:
- Web applications
- Internal tools
- MVPs
- Educational projects
- All-in-one service dashboards

---

## 2. Core Architectural Principles
- **Single Codebase** — All layers live within the same repository.
- **Unified Deployment** — One build and release pipeline.
- **Shared Libraries** — Common code accessible across layers.
- **Strict Modularity** — Even within a monolith, maintain clear boundaries.
- **Integrated Security & Monitoring** — Included from the earliest stages.

---

## 3. Logical Layers

### 3.1 Frontend Layer
- Handles user interactions and presentation logic.
- May use: Angular, React, Vue, Svelte, or static HTML/CSS/JS.

### 3.2 Backend Layer
- Processes requests, handles business rules, and communicates with data storage.
- May use: Spring Boot, Express.js, Django, Laravel, Ruby on Rails, etc.

### 3.3 Database Layer
- Persistent storage (SQL or NoSQL).
- Options: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB, etc.

### 3.4 Shared Components
- Common models, DTOs, validation logic, constants.
- Avoids code duplication between layers.

## 5. Recommended DevOps Workflow
Version Control — Git repository with branching strategy (main, dev, feature/*).

Build Process — Build both frontend and backend in one pipeline.

Testing — Unit + integration tests for all layers.

Packaging — Docker image containing the entire stack.

Deployment — Single deployment step to the chosen environment.

Monitoring — Application performance and error tracking.

Security — Dependency scanning, authentication, and authorization.

## 6. Advantages
Simplicity — Less moving parts, faster onboarding.

Speed — Rapid development without service orchestration overhead.

Unified Data Model — Consistent schema across the entire app.

Predictable Deployment — Fewer integration points to fail.

## 7. Limitations
Scaling must be done for the whole app, not individual layers.

Larger codebases can become harder to maintain without strong modularity.

Slower builds as the application grows.

## 8. Adaptation Notes
When using this blueprint for a specific project:

Swap out frontend/backend frameworks as needed.

Choose a database type suited to your data model.

Customize DevOps tooling (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.).

Integrate security and monitoring tools relevant to your environment.
