## 📏 Development Rules
- **Frontend:** Angular CLI, strict typing, modular design, SCSS.
- **Backend:** Layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository), DTOs, `application.yml` profiles.
- **Code Style:** ESLint + Prettier (Angular), Checkstyle/SpotBugs (Java).
- **Testing:** Target 80%+ coverage; unit + integration tests mandatory.
- **Documentation:**  
  - `README.md` with setup, tech overview, deployment guide.  
  - `/docs/` folder for architecture diagrams, API contracts, and major decisions.

---

## 📂 Architecture Overview
- Single repository with `/frontend/` and `/backend/` directories.
- Unified deployment: Spring Boot serves API + static Angular files (or via NGINX).
- Shared constants/types between layers (when applicable).
- Flyway migrations for DB versioning.

---

## 🌱 Workflow
- Branching: `main` (prod), `dev` (staging), `feature/*` (isolated).
- Pull requests for **all merges**, even solo, with self-review.
- Weekly sprint cadence + retrospective.
- Track backlog in Notion or Trello.

---

## 🚀 CI/CD & Deployment
- **GitHub Actions:** Lint → Build → Unit Tests → Package.
- **Jenkins:** Build Docker image → Push to registry → Deploy.
- Secrets stored securely in OpenShift/Azure Key Vault.
- Optional staging branch for preview deployments.

---

## 🔍 Monitoring & Security
- Datadog for metrics, Elasticsearch for logs.
- OWASP Top 10 adherence.
- SonarQube, Fortify, and JFrog Xray scans on schedule.
- Input validation, output escaping, hashed passwords.

---

## 🛡 Maintainability
- Track technical debt in backlog; refactor monthly.
- Keep modules decoupled and layers clean.
- Avoid circular dependencies.
- Review architecture quarterly.

---

## ✅ Definition of Done
A task is **done** when:
1. Code merged to `main` with all tests passing.
2. No critical/high security issues.
3. Deployed to target environment.
4. Documentation updated.

---

## 🤝 Future Collaboration (Optional)
If adding contributors:
- Maintain onboarding guide in `/docs/`.
- Use shared workspace (Notion/Slack/Discord) for comms.
- Enforce same PR, testing, and style rules.
