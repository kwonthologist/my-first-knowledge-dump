## 📏 Development Principles
- Keep code **readable** and **modular**.
- Use a **layered architecture** (Controller → Service → Repository).
- Maintain **80%+ test coverage**.
- Write **self-documenting code** and update `README.md` regularly.

---

## 📂 Structure (Example)
/frontend → UI code (Angular/React)

/backend → API + business logic

/docs → Diagrams, API contracts, decisions


---

## 🌱 Workflow
- Branching:  
  - `main` → production-ready  
  - `dev` → staging  
  - `feature/*` → new features  
- All merges via Pull Request (self-review if solo).
- Weekly mini-sprint with backlog tracking (Notion/Trello).

---

## 🚀 CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions**: Lint → Build → Test.
- **Jenkins** (optional): Build Docker → Deploy.
- Store secrets in a secure vault (Azure Key Vault, OpenShift secrets, `.env` with gitignore).

---

## 🔍 Security & Performance
- Validate inputs, escape outputs.
- Use secure password hashing.
- Run dependency scans regularly.
- Monitor logs and performance metrics.

---

## ✅ Definition of Done
1. Feature implemented & merged to `main`.
2. All tests pass.
3. No critical security issues.
4. Deployment successful.
5. Docs updated.
